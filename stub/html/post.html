                        Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.[1] Hendrix
                        expanded
                        the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before.
                        His
                        boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as distortion
                        forever
                        transformed the sound of rock and roll. While creating his unique musical voice and guitar
                        style,
                        Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, British rock, American folk
                        music, 1950s
                        rock and roll, psychedelic and jazz. Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and
                        gain.[119] He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar
                        amplifier
                        feedback, and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock.[348] He rejected
                        the
                        standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th
                        string
                        root notes with his thumb.[349] He applied this technique during the beginning bars of "Little
                        Wing",
                        which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has
                        been
                        described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the
                        other
                        fingers playing melody as a right hand.[350] Having spent several years fronting a trio, he
                        developed an
                        ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more
                        than one
                        guitarist was performing.[351][nb 41] He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic
                        phasing
                        effects in rock music recordings.[354] Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix
                        pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had
                        experimented
                        with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled,
                        fluid
                        vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."[3][nb 42] Aledort wrote: "In
                        rock
                        guitar, there are but two eras � before Hendrix and after Hendrix."
