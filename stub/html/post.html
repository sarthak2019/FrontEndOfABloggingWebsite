                    Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.[1] Hendrix
                    expanded
                    the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before.
                    His
                    boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as distortion
                    forever
                    transformed the sound of rock and roll. While creating his unique musical voice and guitar
                    style,
                    Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, British rock, American folk
                    music, 1950s
                    rock and roll, psychedelic and jazz. Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and
                    gain.[119] He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar
                    amplifier
                    feedback, and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock.[348] He rejected
                    the
                    standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th
                    string
                    root notes with his thumb.[349] He applied this technique during the beginning bars of "Little
                    Wing",
                    which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has
                    been
                    described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the
                    other
                    fingers playing melody as a right hand.[350] Having spent several years fronting a trio, he
                    developed an
                    ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more
                    than one
                    guitarist was performing.[351][nb 41] He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic
                    phasing
                    effects in rock music recordings.[354] Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix
                    pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had
                    experimented
                    with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled,
                    fluid
                    vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."[3][nb 42] Aledort wrote: "In
                    rock
                    guitar, there are but two eras ï¿½ before Hendrix and after Hendrix."
